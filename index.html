      <p>
        Hello, my name is Jordan. I am a 24 years old and native to North Carolina. Though my hometown is in North Carolina, I have resided in many areas across the United States. Part of this was through my prior career as a military service member. Before enlisting in the military, I attended school at NCSU. I have always expressed interest in programming and web development, which led for my most current move to Portland, OR. I stumbled upon Epicodus while researching another popular coding school. However, I became enamoured with Epicodus after reading reviews and testimonials from prior alumni. Though I have only been in Oregon long, I am excited to see the beautiful landscape. I've heard that Oregon is a haven to outdoor activites, and I am ready to put it to the test.
